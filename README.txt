Info to run code: Load packages tkinter and tweepy

Reflection: This is a very minimal project that (I think) just barely
meets the requirements. I am not extremely familiar with Python, however it was 
the easiest language to get the project working for me.If I were to do this 
project over again, I would make sure to design my classes better and have them
interact better with each other. Furthermore, if I were more familiar with APIs
and JS/React, I would have put more effort in making the UI better designed and
the UX more seamless.

Lastly, I am very willing to learn and would love to join Change++ to grow and 
become better at software development!
